# Udemy Clean Window

I developed a simple script designed to enhance the Udemy viewing experience. When you install this, it can see **"Clean window"** button after/below video in left side.

Key features of the script include:
- Closing the sidebar
- Toggling the video player control bar (hide/show)
- Toggling the title bar and shadow (hide/show)
- Adjusting the video to fit the window size (not full screen)
- Automatically scrolling to the video position

> [!TIP]
> Please note that this button is **toggle** button, so can hide or show video player control bar and title bar.

## Install:

- Step 1: Install browser extension that can run JS files. Example: [Orange Monkey Pro for Chrome Browser](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/orangemonkey-pro/ggdmdoodcfamjggeigifpjfnnjfbland?hl=en "Orange Monkey Pro for Chrome")
- Step 2: Download https://github.com/indramal/Udemy-Clean-Window/blob/main/Udemy-Clean-Window.js file and add it to extension.
